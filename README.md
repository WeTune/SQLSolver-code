# SQLSolver: Proving Query Equivalence Using Linear Integer Arithmetic

SQLSolver is an automated prover that verifies the equivalence of SQL queries, which is presented in the paper "[Proving Query Equivalence Using Linear Integer Arithmetic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3626768)" (SIGMOD 2024). This project has been moved to the [new repository](https://github.com/SJTU-IPADS/SQLSolver/).
